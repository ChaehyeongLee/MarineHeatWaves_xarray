## Usage Examples

### Basic Single Point Analysis
```python

import marineheatwaves_xarray as mhw

# Load SST data
sst = xr.open_dataset('sst_data.nc').sst

# Detect marine heat waves
mhw_events, climatology = mhw.detect(
    sst,
    climatology_period=(1982, 2012),
    percentile=90.0,
    min_duration=5
)

# Analyze results
print(f"Detected {mhw_events['n_events']} events")
```

### Multi-dimensional Regional Analysis
```python
# Extract regional data
sst_region = sst.sel(lat=slice(-20, 20), lon=slice(120, 280))

# Calculate regional average
sst_mean = sst_region.mean(dim=['lat', 'lon'])

# Detect MHWs
mhw_events, climatology = mhw.detect(sst_mean)

# Calculate block statistics
block_stats = mhw.blockAverage(sst_mean.time, mhw_events)
```
